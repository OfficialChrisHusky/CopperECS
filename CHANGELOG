-Removed the SceneView Constructor that takes in a non pointer Scene
-Fixed a Bug Where if there was only one object that didn't have the component you specified in SceneView it would
 Still return it
-Added SetObjectName and GetObjectName in Registry.h, pretty self explanatory, if you want these functions to be
 a function of Object class you will need to add the definition into a .cpp file
